## plaese folowe this principles for migrations good practice


1) Incorporate Timestamps for Ordering:

    Format: Use a timestamp at the beginning of the filename to ensure migrations are applied sequentially.
    >>> Example: 20250219181305_create_users_table.sql
    Reasoning: Timestamps prevent conflicts and ambiguities, especially in collaborative environments where multiple 
    developers might create migrations simultaneously.

2) Use Descriptive Names:

    Format: After the timestamp, include a concise description of the migration's purpose,
    using underscores to separate words.
    >>> Example: 20250219181305_add_email_to_users.sql
    Reasoning: Descriptive names provide immediate insight into what the migration accomplishes,
    aiding in code readability and maintenance.

3) Use naming syntax like the first letter must be upercase and has prefex of name of the table and underscore
    >>> Exemple:✅ Recommended version (snake_case for consistency):

The folder should looke like this 

migrations/
│   ├── 20250219181305_create_users_table.sql
│   ├── 20250219182010_add_email_to_users.sql
│   └── 20250219182545_create_posts_table.sql
